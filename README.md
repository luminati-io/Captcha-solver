# How CAPTCHA Solver Works  

Bright Dataâ€™s CAPTCHA Solver is integrated into the **Scraping Browser** and **Web Unlocker** to **automatically solve CAPTCHAs** by default. You can:  

- Monitor the solving process in your code  
- Manually toggle CAPTCHA-solving behavior using Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) commands  
- Fully disable CAPTCHA solving if desired  



## **Automatic CAPTCHA Solving**  

Use the `Captcha.solve` command to detect and resolve CAPTCHAs automatically.

### Command Overview  

```javascript
Captcha.solve({
    detectTimeout?: number // Timeout for CAPTCHA detection in milliseconds  
    options?: CaptchaOptions[] // Configuration options for CAPTCHA solving  
}) : SolveResult
```

### Example: NodeJS (Puppeteer)

```javascript
const page = await browser.newPage();
const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();
await page.goto('https://site-with-captcha.com');

// Automatically solve CAPTCHA  
const { status } = await client.send('Captcha.solve', { detectTimeout: 30000 });   
console.log(`CAPTCHA solve status: ${status}`);
```

### Events Monitoring  

You can listen for specific CAPTCHA-solving events to handle advanced use cases:  

- **`Captcha.detected`**: CAPTCHA detected and solving has started  
- **`Captcha.solveFinished`**: CAPTCHA solved successfully  
- **`Captcha.solveFailed`**: CAPTCHA solving failed  
- **`Captcha.waitForSolve`**: Waiting for CAPTCHA solver to complete  

#### NodeJS Example - Listening for Events

```javascript
const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();   
await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {   
  client.on('Captcha.solveFinished', resolve);   
  client.on('Captcha.solveFailed', () => reject(new Error('CAPTCHA solving failed')));   
  setTimeout(reject, 300000, new Error('CAPTCHA solve timeout'));  
});
```

## Manual CAPTCHA Management

Need full control? Configure the behavior or disable solving entirely.

### Disable Automatic CAPTCHA Solving

```javascript
Captcha.setAutoSolve({  
  autoSolve: false // Disable CAPTCHA solving  
});
```

### Disable CAPTCHA Auto-Solve for Specific Types

```javascript
Captcha.setAutoSolve({  
  autoSolve: true,  
  options: [{  
    type: 'usercaptcha', // Disable auto-solving for this CAPTCHA type  
    disabled: true  
  }]  
});
```

### Manually Solve CAPTCHAs

```javascript
const page = await browser.newPage();  
const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();
await client.send('Captcha.setAutoSolve', { autoSolve: false });  
await page.goto('https://site-with-captcha.com');
const { status } = await client.send('Captcha.solve', { detectTimeout: 30000 });
console.log('CAPTCHA solve status:', status);
```
